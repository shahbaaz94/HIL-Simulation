Folder structure:

Important plots.docx and three videos are for quick-review.

Mainly we control mu the friction coefficient to achieve traction/launch/speed/brake
control. We set 2 senarios to demonstrate system performance.

"HIL_simulator1 PID control mu max speed traction_launch_speed_brake" is to accelerate 
to max speed(800 rads/s), stay at the speed for a while, and then brake.

"HIL_simulator2 PID control mu normal speed traction_launch_speed_brake" is to accelerate 
to certain speed below 800 rads/s, stay at that speed for a while, and then brake.

We added a last minute modification to our launch control and traction control. Basically we
change to control slipratio instead of mu.

"HIL_simulator3 PID control slipratio traction_launch" demonstrate our result.

Two folders with "simulation" in their names are simulation results of the two methods 
mentioned above.

Three videos show the 3 runs of 3 HIL simulators, 3 mins each.

Three documents contains records of all the test runs, including the final results. All the
plots in the final report are from these docs.

All folders include history .txt or .csv files containing final test data.
